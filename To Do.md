Bugs
✅checkout page wont close when top up now is clicked 

UX REFINEMENTS
✅Sign Up/Sign In - dilipa dapat ma click ditso ang text fields kay mawala ang prompt text thus the user wont know what is the field for - ALTERNATIVE WAS INITIATED
✅Back button z- should return to the previous page rather than the home screen - REMOVED!
✅Search button - automatically search the game after passing to the browse page, do not let the user click it twice in the browse page 
- Add current wallet balance to the header 
- Add the number of items in the cart in the icon in the navbar
